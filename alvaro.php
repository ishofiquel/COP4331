                  <h4>Appearance<h4>
                  <p>The American Eel is also know as the pencil eel, yellow eel, black eel, silver eel, Boston eel, Atlantic eel or common eel.

                  The body is extremely elongated (snakelike), with a very long dorsal fin that is confluent with the anal fin.  Pelvic fins are absent and tiny scales are embedded in the skin giving eels a smooth feel.  The adult color is a yellow-brown with pale underbelly.

                  It is a distinct species with no known subspecies.  Similar species exist around Japan, Australia and Europe.

                  This is a gourmet fish in the Asian markets and is often used in Sushi.  It tends to be bony by American standards but is good smoked.</p>
                  <hr class="featurette-divider">
                  <h4>Habitat<h4>
                  <p>American eels are found in waters with coastal access along the Atlantic seaboard of the US. 

                  Eels are primarily riverine but access ponds and lakes.  They orient to structure and flow.</p>
                  <hr class="featurette-divider">
                  <h4>Behavior<h4>
                  <p>Spawning is still not well understood but fascinating.  The adults migrate to the ocean during autumn.  During the long trek the fish metamorphose into a "silver eel" stage lose their vision and stop eating.  Meanwhile, the gonads expand dramatically.  The fish head to a location near the Sargasso Sea where they spawn en masse and apparently die.  The eggs hatch into leaf-shaped floating leptocephalus larvae that drift with the currents.  When they come within range of a freshwater river, the leptocephalus metamorphoses again into a tiny semi-transparent "glass eel" that buries itself in the sand.  The glass eel that changes again into a pigmented pencil eel and continues its migration upstream to find a habitat to mature and await it's time to go spawn.  This process of spawning in the ocean and maturing inland is termed catadromy (the fish are catadromous).

                  American eels are opportunistic feeders, which means they eat whatever food is available to them. They are considered carnivorous and eat a variety of food, including fish, frogs, insects and dead organisms.

                  American eels are known to live as long as 43 years, but generally migrate to spawn and die long before then.</p>

                  <p>Historically the sport fishery was mostly a troll boat fishery with some spin casting from the bank. In recent times, fly fishing has become very popular. The sport fishery is primarily located between Sanford and Melbourne. The flesh is good, especially smoked, and the roe is excellent.</p>

                  <p>Live worms or crickets are the best bait, either fished on the bottom or suspended below a float. Crickets, grubs, sand maggots or grass shrimp will also catch bedding bluegill. Use a small hook, #6 or #8, with a split shot sinker about 6 inches up the line. Concentrate on water less than 6 feet deep. For artificial baits, a 1/8 oz. “beetle spin” with a white or chartreuse body on ultralight tackle is excellent.</p>

                  <p>The bowfin is the only living representative of an ancient family of fishes. It has an air-bladder that functions like a lung, and can be seen gulping air. They have a long, stout body; big mouth with small, sharp teeth; long dorsal and rounded tail fin. Males have a dark spot with a bright orange halo on the tail fin.

                  <p>Catfish are easy to distinguish by their whisker-like sensory barbels and a forked tail. Channel catfish have a rounded anal fin and scattered black spots along their back and sides. Males become especially dark during spawning season and develop a thickened pad on their head.</p>

                  <h4>Fishing Tips and Facts<h4>
                  <p>Catfish are a staple for anglers who eat their catch. Use baits with strong odors: chicken liver or gizzards, shrimp, cut mullet and commercial stinkbaits. Catfish are most active just before dusk and at night. Fish on the bottom with a sturdy #2 to #4 hook and a heavy split shot sinker. Be careful of sharp spines when handling these fish. The FWC stocks 200,000-300,000 annually in public waters.</p>

                  <h4>Habitat<h4>
                  <p>Flathead are found in the Apalachicola and Escambia rivers, where they recently arrived from Georgia and Alabama. Flatheads prefer long, slow-flowing, moderately-turbid rivers.</p>

                  <h4>Appearance<h4>
                  <p>The largemouth bass is the best known and most popular game fish in North America. It is distinguished from other black bass because the upper jaw extends beyond the rear edge of the eye, and the first and second dorsal (back) fins are separated by an obvious deep dip.</p>
                  <hr class="featurette-divider">
                  <h4>Habitat<h4>
                  <p>The Florida largemouth bass is the state freshwater fish. Found statewide in lakes and rivers, they are commonly found along vegetation, or underwater structure, but schooling bass are also found in the middle of lakes.</p>
                  <hr class="featurette-divider">
                  <h4>Behavior<h4>
                  <p>Black bass spawn in spring, when males fan out a bed and then protect the eggs and fry. The baby fish eat zooplankton (microscopic animals that drift in the water column), and when about an inch long begin eating other small fish. Adults eat a wide variety of fish, crustaceans and larger insects.</p>

                  <h4>Fishing Tips and Facts<h4>
                  <p>Florida is an outstanding destination to catch a trophy. A photo and measurements of your fish can be converted into lifelike fiberglass mounts, so you can release the lunker to fight another day. The best live bait is a golden shiner, fished under a float or free-lined. Typically, the shiner is hooked through the lips or back with a large hook, 2/0 to 5/0. A medium to medium-heavy rod with 14- to 20-pound test line is preferred, particularly when fishing in areas with thick vegetation or cover. Plastic worms are the most dependable artificial bait for largemouth bass. A weedless Texas- or Carolina-rigged worm is especially effective with heavy plant cover. Checking “Florida Fishing Weekly” is a great way to learn about the full array of techniques available to bass anglers as well as specific details about different bass fisheries around the state.</p>

                  <p>Although historically found in the Apalachicola River, habitat degradation has all but eliminated shoal bass from the river proper. Very limited numbers of shoal bass can be found just downstream from Jim Woodruff Dam, where a few "shoal" type habitats still remain.  The best destination to catch shoal bass in Florida is the Chipola River.</p>

                  <p>Shoal bass primarily eat crustaceans (crayfish) but will also eat a variety of fish and insects. Shoal bass are primarily found among river shoals (shallow, fast moving riffles and runs containing limestone) but larger shoal bass can often be found in the deeper pools containing limestone formations above and below the shoals.</p>

Spinnerbaits, jerkbaits, and small crankbaits also work well. Spring and Fall are the best times to fish for shoal bass, but fishing can also be good throughout the summer months. Although not as popular as its largemouth cousin, shoal bass are pound-for-pound one of the top fighters in the black bass family. Checking "Florida Fishing Weekly" is a great way to learn about the full array of techniques available to bass anglers as well as specific details about different bass fisheries around the state.</p>

                  <h4>Appearance<h4>
                  <p>A heavy-bodied black bass that seldom exceeds 12 inches long. Mature Suwannee bass have bright turquoise coloring on the cheeks, breast, and belly. The upper jaw does not extend beyond the eye, and there is only a shallow notch between the dorsal fins. A distinct dark blotch where the lateral line meets the caudal fin and scales on bases of dorsal, anal and caudal fins further identify Suwannee bass.</p>

                  <p>Widespread and abundant in Florida; found in fertile lakes, ponds, rivers, streams, and canals. It is tolerant of saltwater and found in some near shore marine habitats, such as Tampa Bay.<br>
                  Native to north Africa and the Middle East.</p>
                  <hr class="featurette-divider">
                  <h4>Behavior<h4>
                  <p><b>Spawning Habits:</b> Spawning occurs when the water temperature exceeds 68oF. Males dig large circular nests with their mouths in shallow water over a sandy bottom. The male swims out to a passing female and leads her to the nest where courtship occurs; female lays eggs and immediately takes into mouth after male fertilizes, after which she swims off, possibly to mate with another male. The males continue to guard nests and may spawn again with another female. Eggs hatch in female's mouth, and fry occasionally released to feed, but whenever threatened they return to the female's mouth until they are about three weeks old. This type of parental care is called mouth-brooding.<br>
                  <b>Feeding Habits:</b> Feed primarily on plankton and small organisms living in or on bottom detritus; three most common foods consumed in Lake Alice and Lake George were diatoms, green algae, and detritus; dominant food items in stomachs of fish from Six-Mile Creek near Tampa were detritus, algae, diatoms, and plant material.</p>

                  <p>Brown hoplo is less than a foot long and belongs to family of fishes known as Callichthyidae; has bony armor consisting of two rows of large hard scales forming plate-like armor along each side; dark brown to black in color with two pairs of long barbells on chin.</p>
                  <hr class="featurette-divider">
                  <h4>Habitat<h4>
                  <p>Occur in a variety of freshwater habitats including muddy bottom and slow moving rivers, streams, side channels, ponds, marshes, and man-made waterways such as ditches and borrow pits; larvae and juveniles inhabit shallow water areas with lots of vegetation; adults prefer foraging in deeper, open water areas; gulps air, and tolerant of both low oxygen and high hydrogen-sulfide levels.</p>
                  <hr class="featurette-divider">
                  <h4>Behavior<h4>
                  <p><b>Spawning Habitats:<b> Males build floating nests in vegetation near shore that consist of bubbles covered with plant material. Eggs are released by the female below the nest. The male fertilizes them and then takes them into his mouth and blows them up into the floating nest. Breeding males develop enlarged, red pectoral spines with hooks at the tips that are used to defend territories against other males. The eggs hatch in about four days.<br>
                  <b>Feeding Habits:<b> Primarily feeds on benthic invertebrates and detritus.</p>

                  <h4>Appearance<h4>
                  <p>The grass carp is actually one of the largest members of the minnow family. The back of the grass carp is silvery to dark grey, and the sides of the body are lighter with a slightly golden sheen. The belly is silvery white. Fins are generally greenish-grey. The fish has relatively large scales. The body shape is oblong with a round belly and broad head. Teeth have been replaced by specialized structures called pharyngeal teeth (see photo) located in the back of the throat. These are used for tearing and grinding plant matter.<br>
                  By contrast, common carp have a laterally compressed, robust body (deep bodied from the back of the fish to the belly) and are easily distinguished by the presence of barbels (whiskers) located at the corners of the mouth. Suckers have smaller scales than grass carp or common carp and unlike the carp have large lipped, sucker-like mouths located well below the head.</p>

                  <h4>Habitat<h4>
                  <p>Only occurs where stocked within Florida. In its native range it occurs in lakes, ponds, pools and backwaters of large rivers but prefers large, slow-flowing or standing water bodies with vegetation. They are tolerant of temperatures from freezing to over 100 ÂºF; salinities as high as 10 ppt (brackish), and oxygen levels down to 0.5 ppm.</p>

                  <p>Broadcast spawners the females lay copious amounts of eggs in free-flowing rivers that are then fertilized by the male. The eggs must remain suspended in the flow until they hatch or they will perish. Ideally, at the time the eggs hatch they will be in a well vegetated area with abundant zooplankton.</p>

Pacus (Colossoma spp.), and silver dollars (Metynnis spp.) as well as Myleus spp. and Mylossoma spp. have molar-like teeth used for crushing food.  In telling Piranhas from Metynnis and other silver dollars, the angle of the jaw is a pretty good characteristic for sorting them...forward jutting lower jaw that forms a V at the angle is a piranha, even upper and lower jaw profile that forms a U at the angle of the jaw is not a piranha.</p>

                  <p>All three suckermouth catfishes (family Loricariidae) in Florida have rows of bony plates covering all but their belly area. Sailfin catfish are distinguished by worm-like pattern of dark markings on the head over a dark-golden background; pectoral fins stout with rough surfaces resembling course sandpaper; disc-like, protrusible mouth is under the head, and used like a suction cup to attach and feed on algae; females tend to be smaller, and fish larger than 18 inches probably males; lifeless and hollowed-out 'armored' bodies sometimes seen on canal and lake banks.</p>

                  <h4>Habitat<h4>
                  <p>Sailfin catfish live in nearly any type of slow moving streams, canals, ponds, and lakes; and are normally most abundant along the shore and in shallower waters. They are known to create spawning burrows along shorelines, sometimes undermining canal banks and lake shorelines. Little is known about the vermiculated sailfin's specific habitat preferences; poor success of suckermouth catfish to date indicates it is less well adapted to Florida waters than are the sailfins.</p>

                  <h4>Behavior<h4>
                  <p><b>Spawning Habitats:</b> Male and females start maturing when 13 and 11 inches long; female lays about 2,000 eggs in shoreline burrows, holes, or crevices generally between April and September; nests guarded until eggs hatch; adhesive eggs clump together in masses; egg masses are sometimes collected from the wild, aerated, hatched, and grown on tropical fish farms for sale in the pet industry.<br>
                  <b>Feeding Habits:</b> 100% of stomachs that were examined contained detritus, and most also contained algae, sand, small freshwater bivalves, water fleas, and decaying matter; most active around dusk when root around bottom looking for worms and insect larvae; sucker-like mouth used to scrape algae from stones and other surfaces with their spoon shaped teeth.</p>

                  <h4>Appearance<h4>
                  <p>The grass carp is actually one of the largest members of the minnow family. The back of the grass carp is silvery to dark grey, and the sides of the body are lighter with a slightly golden sheen. The belly is silvery white. Fins are generally greenish-grey. The fish has relatively large scales. The body shape is oblong with a round belly and broad head. Teeth have been replaced by specialized structures called pharyngeal teeth (see photo) located in the back of the throat. These are used for tearing and grinding plant matter.<br>
                  By contrast, common carp have a laterally compressed, robust body (deep bodied from the back of the fish to the belly) and are easily distinguished by the presence of barbels (whiskers) located at the corners of the mouth. Suckers have smaller scales than grass carp or common carp and unlike the carp have large lipped, sucker-like mouths located well below the head.</p>
                  <hr class="featurette-divider">
                  <h4>Habitat<h4>
                  <p>Only occurs where stocked within Florida. In its native range it occurs in lakes, ponds, pools and backwaters of large rivers but prefers large, slow-flowing or standing water bodies with vegetation. They are tolerant of temperatures from freezing to over 100 ÂºF; salinities as high as 10 ppt (brackish), and oxygen levels down to 0.5 ppm.</p>
                  <hr class="featurette-divider">
                  <h4>Behavior<h4>
                  <p>Broadcast spawners the females lay copious amounts of eggs in free-flowing rivers that are then fertilized by the male. The eggs must remain suspended in the flow until they hatch or they will perish. Ideally, at the time the eggs hatch they will be in a well vegetated area with abundant zooplankton.</p>

Bow-anglers are especially adept at taking grass carp and are sometimes given permits to remove excess grass carp.</p>

                  <hr class="featurette-divider">
                  <h4>Habitat<h4>
                  <p>Young usually are inshore during spring and summer and move offshore to join adults during fall and winter. Large numbers of bluefish migrate to Florida from northern stocks during winter. Anglers on the east coast catch larger bluefish than fishermen on the west coast.</p>
                  <hr class="featurette-divider">
                  <h4>Behavior<h4>
                  <p>Bluefish travel in large schools following baitfish. Members of a school tend to be about the same size because they are cannibalistic. Spawning occurs offshore in spring and summer.</p>

                  <h4>Fishing Tips and Facts<h4>
                  <p>Bluefish may be caught from boat or shore. Chumming is a helpful, and a wire leader is a must to prevent fish from biting through the line. Anglers use a variety of plugs, sand eel type jigs, and squid- or mackerel-like lures. Pogies, mackerel or eels are good live baits and cut bait works too. Average size is 3-5 pounds. These fish are a bit oily for some people, so gut them and clean them as soon as you legally can.</p>

                  <hr class="featurette-divider">
                  <h4>Behavior<h4>
                  <p>Bonefish have deeply forked tails that provide power for chasing prey in lush grass beds. Keen eyesight and a skittish nature make these fish a prized trophy for saltwater anglers. They travel in small schools prowling grass beds and sand flats for shrimp, crabs and other invertebrates. Average size is 3 to 5 pounds but fish weighing more than 10 pounds can be found in Florida.</p>

                  <h4>Fishing Tips and Facts<h4>
                  <p> Red drum are one of Florida’s most popular sport fish and the state’s most widespread estuarine fish. Floating a live shrimp under a popping cork is a good way to fish for redfish. They also chase crabs, mullet, pinfish and killifish (mud minnows). Casting soft-bodied jigs, spoons and even top-water plugs will catch the attention of these powerful estuarine musicians. Redfish make great table fare.</p>

                  <h4>Fishing Tips and Facts<h4>
                  <p>Free-line live shrimp or small pinfish or pigfish (grunts) near the bottom to entice trout out of grass-bed holes. Attaching a float will allow these baits to drift over the grass beds as you search for trout. Casting with soft-bodied jigs, top-water poppers and spoons can be effective. Trout are very delicate, so returning unwanted or illegal fish promptly to the water is necessary to maintain a healthy population. Spotted seatrout are a good eating fish.</p>

                  <h4>Habitat<h4>
                  <p>Snook are found from central Florida south, usually inshore in coastal and brackish waters.  They are also common along mangrove shorelines, seawalls, and bridges.  Snook are also on reefs and around pilings nearshore.</p>
                  <hr class="featurette-divider">
                  <h4>Behavior<h4>
                  <p>They congregate in large schools during summer in deep passes and inlets to spawn. Snook begin life as males, but between 18 and 22 inches long some become females.  Spawning occurs primarily in summer.  Snook school along shore and in passes during spawning season.  They feed on fish and large crustaceans.</p>

                  <h4>Fishing Tips and Facts<h4>
                  <p>They orient themselves to face moving water and wait for prey to be carried down the current. Snook jump clear of the water, and burst into long runs. Use live pinfish, small mullet, shrimp, or sardines free-lined or fished off the bottom with a fish finder rig. They take a large variety of lures based on water conditions. Beware of the snook’s razor-sharp gill covers! Snook make excellent table fare.</p>

                  <h4>Appearance<h4>
                  <p>What is there to appreciate about a big fish? Plenty, say scientists who study the Gulf sturgeon. The Gulf sturgeon grows to greater than six feet in length, sports bony plates on its head and body, has fleshy "whiskers" on its long snout, and no internal skeleton. This ancient fish evolved from much larger ancestors that lived more than 225 million years ago. Gulf sturgeon may live for more than 40 years, not reaching sexual maturity until seven or eight years of age or later.</p>
                  <hr class="featurette-divider">
                  <h4>Habitat<h4>
                  <p>Sturgeon are anadromous, a term used to describe fish that spend a part of their lives in saltwater, yet travel upstream in freshwater rivers to spawn. Such fish return year after year to the same stream where they were hatched. For Gulf sturgeon, which are found from Florida to Louisiana, this means a move from salt to fresh water between February and April and a move downriver between September and November. They spend the winter in the Gulf of Mexico in sandy-bottom habitats six to 100 feet deep, where their diet consists of marine worms, grass shrimp, crabs and a variety of other bottom-dwelling organisms. They eat very little while in freshwater rivers.</p>
                  <hr class="featurette-divider">
                  <h4>Behavior<h4>
                  <p>Little is known about the early life stages of the Gulf sturgeon throughout its range.   After the late 1800s, Gulf sturgeon populations declined dramatically, a result of the high demand for their delicious meat and valuable roe, and dam construction, dredging activity and other man-made habitat alterations. The decline prompted state and federal officials to place the sturgeon on the protected species lists in the 1980s and 1990s and to enact a harvesting and possession ban. Today, the free-flowing, spring-fed Suwannee River supports the largest and most robust population of Gulf sturgeon in the state and the wider Gulf of Mexico region. Adults spawn on scoured limestone substrates in the upper reaches of this 200-mile long river. As they swim along, sturgeon occasionally leap out of the water. Every spring and summer, lucky boaters and campers along the Suwannee River witness this spectacle. Power boaters can reduce the risk of injury to themselves and the fish by boating slower during the appropriate time of year. This also increases the chance of seeing the sturgeon and other wildlife along the way.</p>

                  <hr class="featurette-divider">
                  <h4>Behavior<h4>
                  <p>Tarpon can gulp air and remove oxygen by means of lung-like tissue near their swim bladder. This "rolling" effect is one way to spot tarpon. Anglers catch tarpon that weigh 40 to 150 pounds on average. Tarpon do not mature until 7 to 13 years of age. They spawn offshore between May and September.</p>

                  <p>Live shrimp or pinfish make good baits, but plastics and Keys-style streamers work too. When sight fishing, land your presentation softly in front of a tarpon at an angle that lets you withdraw your lure away from the tarpon. Tarpon are not eaten. A tarpon tag is required for harvest.</p>
